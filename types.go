// go comes with multiple type 
// bool => True or False
// Numberic Types int8 , int16 , int32 , int64 , int  
        int8 => represent 8 bit -128 to 127 
        int16 => represent 16 bit -32768 to 32767
        int32 => represent 32 bit -2147483648 to 2147483647
        int64 => represent 64 bit -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
        int => can use 32 or 64 bit systems  
        You should generally be using int to represent integers unless there is a need to use a specific sized integer.
